# ManifoldTriangulation
The TriangulateManifold class is a tool in MATLAB that helps you to create a 3D model of a surface by connecting points on that surface with triangles. This can be useful for a wide range of applications, such as computer graphics or data visualization. With this tool, you can easily approximate the shape of a surface given a set of points on it.
